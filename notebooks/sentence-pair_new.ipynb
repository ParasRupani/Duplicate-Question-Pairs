    "Once we've generated paraphrased sentences for each question, we match the first two duplicates with the original question to create similar question pairs. Then, we shuffle the remaining three duplicates to produce a set of dissimilar questions. It's important to note that when shuffling samples to create dissimilar question pairs, there might be instances where two similar questions are mistakenly paired as dissimilar. Similarly, in the similar question set, there could be cases where two dissimilar questions are incorrectly labeled as similar due to ambiguity in the original question. We detect and remove these anomalies from the dataset during the data preprocessing stage.\n"

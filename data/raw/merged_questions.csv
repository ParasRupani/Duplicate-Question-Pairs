"Hi everyone, I have a question regarding my iphone 11 and what do I do to fix it. For some context just incase it matters, I dropped my phone the other day but my screen didnt break besides a small chip near the bottom right. My phone was working fine besides heating up a bit more than usual but there was also a heatwave. Suddenly during the night I got a brief moment of something similar to ghost touch but the issue I have is I am unable to change my keyboard back to English and I am not able to put in my password as it is in English. Whenever I try to click the button to change the language it clicks the 123 for numbers, no other part of the screen is broken. I force restarted and tried using siri to unlock but it didnt help. And now, because I force started I cant do anything. I asked phone shop but they arent sure and told me either to hard restart or fix the screen but I dont want to lose everything and also its expensive to fix the screen and it not being the issue. Will I chance it and fix the screen, the charging port or is it something wrong with the inside of the phone like the touch sensor moved out of place. There doesnt seem to be any other issue than on the bottom left screen pressing the button above where I touch and not letting me click the language button. Any advice will be greatly appreciated."

Write a complete C++ command to implement a ""Sum of Numbers in Range"" (sonir) program. Place all your code inside the main() routine; do not write any extra user-defined functions. To minimize your writing, you do not have to code any comments. Do not forget to show program structure through indentation. This program is invoked with zero or more names of files following the executable name on the command-line. If your program is invoked with no arguments, it should do nothing and return silently. Otherwise, for each filename argument (yes, this means you have to ""open"" and ""close"" each file) read a stream of real numbers from that file and add together (i.e., total) those numbers in the input that are between -99.71 and 450.225, inclusive, and print this sum to standard output with a precision of one decimal point. Be sure this total is not printed in E-notation. You may assume that all files specified exist. For each file, a line is printed giving the filename, a colon, and the sum of the in-range numbers. The following example shows the command being invoked with the names of two files, january.dat and hans.dat. The example shows the resulting two lines of output: each line consisting of a filename, a colon, and sum of the in-range numbers. $ sonir january.dat hans.dat january.dat: 535679.4 hans.dat:-436.7?"

"Hello there, I am confused about a business idea that is it worth pursuing or not? Could you please help me with that? Problem - when someone thinks to start working out they just don't feel like doing it because it's hard to get started with fitness as you may not be able to do a single pushup or squat when you start. Solution-what if we provide people with a company who just help them to get ready to hit the gym or simply getting started with practicing a fit lifestyle. What exactly would the company do?- by giving in-person sessions by professional trainers at their home or any place they like, the courses would include mental and physical education for example, how to train your mind to get started with working out , what should be your mindset and expectations before you start, basic workouts to get started as you may not be able to do a pushup so the trainer would make an easy but effective workout program and would guide you through it. The story doesn't end here, only working out is not enough to make a change in your physical health and body you also need proper diet but the problem people have with diets are
1) hard to prepare (complex ingredients)
2) takes time to get prepared
3) Following a specific diet is confusing as there are many options between food to choose from.
4) last but not least, most diets doesn't taste great so it's hard to consume everyday For these problems, jumpstart has all solutions for you. To guide you to make great tasting diets according to your taste, dietitians from jump start will guide you. Eliminating fast foods(if you are consuming them alot) on the very first day s hard and depressing so the dietitians would not eliminate those food you are consuming right now but they will add a healthy and easy-to-prepare meal in your daily diet after few days or a week and like this it gets a lot easier for you to switch your current diet to a healthy one."

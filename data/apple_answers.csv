"I've got 10 yo iMac. As I don't do any gaming or film editing the comp suits me just fine. I replaced 500Gb HDD with 2Tb SSD a year ago and I don't really see any need for a better desk top comp. Recently I found my iMac totally unresponsive and after unplugging and plugging it back in was offered to restore it from Time Machine which I luckily keep connected. Don't know why there was no option to restore it directly from iCloud (why?) but, hey, I could use TM so good enough. It took two attempts, 6 hrs each to find ""Restore successful"" message on the screen. Today- repeat of the story. But this time I noticed something. The computer shares the double socket with 2kW fan heater. And somebody switched it off by pulling the plug out. I think this is the cause. Am I right? There is only one (double) socket in the room. Is there any way I can prevent this happening again? Something that will separate the sensitive computer from the fluctuations of the power, preferably not costing the earth? Thanks."

For some context just incase it matters, I dropped my phone the other day but my screen didnt break besides a small chip near the bottom right. My phone was working fine besides heating up a bit more than usual but there was also a heatwave. Suddenly during the night I got a brief moment of something similar to ghost touch but the issue I have is I am unable to change my keyboard back to English and I am not able to put in my password as it is in English. Whenever I try to click the button to change the language it clicks the 123 for numbers, no other part of the screen is broken. I force restarted and tried using siri to unlock but it didnt help. And now, because I force started I cant do anything. I asked phone shop but they arent sure and told me either to hard restart or fix the screen but I dont want to lose everything and also its expensive to fix the screen and it not being the issue. Will I chance it and fix the screen, the charging port or is it something wrong with the inside of the phone like the touch sensor moved out of place. There doesnt seem to be any other issue than on the bottom left screen pressing the button above where I touch and not letting me click the language button. Any advice will be greatly appreciated."

I have enough tech background that I can usually fix most of his issues, (e.g. password management, backups, etc…), but I am a 2 hour drive from his house and would like to get some Remote Desktop software so I can take over his computer and show him what I’m doing to fix his issues from my desktop (iMac). It looks like the Apple product (Apple Remote Desktop) isn't very highly rated, while GoToMyPC and ZoHo rate better. As mentioned, my remote functionality requirements are limited; access to one iMac from my iMac. Any recommendations for software solutions and/or things to look for are appreciated in advance.

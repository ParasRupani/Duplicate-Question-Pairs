"Hello there, I am confused about a business idea that is it worth pursuing or not? Could you please help me with that? Problem - when someone thinks to start working out they just don't feel like doing it because it's hard to get started with fitness as you may not be able to do a single pushup or squat when you start. Solution-what if we provide people with a company who just help them to get ready to hit the gym or simply getting started with practicing a fit lifestyle. What exactly would the company do?- by giving in-person sessions by professional trainers at their home or any place they like, the courses would include mental and physical education for example, how to train your mind to get started with working out , what should be your mindset and expectations before you start, basic workouts to get started as you may not be able to do a pushup so the trainer would make an easy but effective workout program and would guide you through it. The story doesn't end here, only working out is not enough to make a change in your physical health and body you also need proper diet but the problem people have with diets are
1) hard to prepare (complex ingredients)
2) takes time to get prepared
3) Following a specific diet is confusing as there are many options between food to choose from.
4) last but not least, most diets doesn't taste great so it's hard to consume everyday For these problems, jumpstart has all solutions for you. To guide you to make great tasting diets according to your taste, dietitians from jump start will guide you. Eliminating fast foods(if you are consuming them alot) on the very first day s hard and depressing so the dietitians would not eliminate those food you are consuming right now but they will add a healthy and easy-to-prepare meal in your daily diet after few days or a week and like this it gets a lot easier for you to switch your current diet to a healthy one."
